# PowerBIDashboard
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of sales and performance metrics for a retail application, Blinkit. It gives detailed insights into various dimensions like total sales, number of items sold, average ratings, and outlet performance based on location, size, and item type.

Technology Used in the Dashboard:
Power BI:

Power BI is a business analytics tool by Microsoft, designed for interactive data visualization and business intelligence. It allows users to create dashboards, reports, and data models with a user-friendly interface.
Data Connectivity: Power BI can connect to various data sources (Excel, SQL, MySQL, web APIs, and more) and import, transform, and model data for analysis.
Visualizations: Power BI provides multiple types of visualizations, like bar charts, pie charts, line charts, tables, and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) as shown in this dashboard.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): A language used within Power BI for creating calculations, measures, and expressions (e.g., calculating total sales, average ratings).
Data Filtering & Drilldown: The left-side filter panel in the dashboard allows users to filter data by outlet location, size, and item type, making the dashboard interactive for users.
Data Modeling and Analytics:

Data Sources: In a real-world scenario, the data displayed in this dashboard may be derived from databases (like SQL Server, MySQL), ERP systems, or cloud platforms.
Data Transformation (Power Query): Power BI’s in-built Power Query tool is often used to clean, shape, and transform the raw data before it’s visualized. This process involves merging, filtering, and shaping the dataset to fit the business requirements.
Data Aggregation and Reporting:

Aggregated Metrics: Metrics such as total sales, average sales, and item count are aggregated at different levels (by outlet size, location, or item type), enabling high-level insights.
KPIs & Performance Indicators: The dashboard uses KPIs like total sales, average sales, and average rating to measure the success of different aspects of the business.
Deployment and Sharing:

Power BI reports can be shared through the Power BI service, embedded in web applications, or integrated with other Microsoft tools (Excel, Teams, etc.) for collaborative analysis and decision-making.
